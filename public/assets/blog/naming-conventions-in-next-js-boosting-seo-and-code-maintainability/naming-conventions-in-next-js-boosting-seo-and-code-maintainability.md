When it comes to building web applications with Next Js, Developers often focus on functionality and design, but there’s another crucial aspect that shouldn’t be overlooked which is The Naming Convention. An Effective Naming convention not only improves code maintainability but also plays a significant role in search engine optimization (SEO). In the Blog Post, We’ll Explore the importance of naming conventions in Next Js development and provide examples of best practices to help you optimize your project for both humans and search engines.

# **What Is Naming Convention**

> In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.. (source: Wikipedia)

Naming conventions also help to prevent naming conflicts and make it easier to identify the purpose and scope of a particular code element. By following a consistent and standardized naming convention, developers can improve the overall quality and maintainability of their code.

In the context of NextJS, naming conventions play an important role in organizing and structuring the code for efficient development and deployment. By following NextJS naming conventions, developers can build better and more maintainable applications. Naming Conventions for Next JS

NextJS doesn’t have any specific guidelines or statements about naming conventions. You’re free to use whatever naming conventions you feel comfortable with. The documentation doesn’t offer any specific recommendations either.

Ultimately, it’s up to you to decide what naming conventions you want to use. However, there are a few different approaches that gained popularity among React Or NextJS developers.

In NextJS applications, there are 3 most common naming conventions:

- Camel case for file names, and Pascal case for component names.
- Kebab case for file names, and Pascal case for component names.
- Pascal case for both file names and component names

As you can see, there is one thing that’s pretty much common. And that’s the convention for component names. A component in React should always use a Pascal case. E.g, **`App`**, **`ServiceSection`** or **`MyAppContainer`**.

Let’s compare the difference to real-life examples. Let’s consider a component called **`ServiceSection`**.

# **Using Camel Case for File Names**

> Camel case is the practice of writing phrases without spaces or punctuation, indicating the separation of words with a single capitalized letter. (source: Wikipedia)

Using camel case, the file name will be **`serviceSection.jsx`**. And the component name will be **`ServiceSection`**.

```jsx
const ServiceSection = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>I Have Camel Case Naming</h1>
      <p>And I'm proud of it!</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ServiceSection;
```

# **Using Kebab Case for File Names**

Using the kebab case, the file name will be `service-section.jsx`.

```jsx
const ServiceSection = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>I Have Kebab Case Naming</h1>
      <p>And I'm also proud of it!</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ServiceSection;
```

# **Using Pascal Case for Both File and Component Name**

Pascal case is following the same format as the camel case. In addition, it requires the first letter to be uppercase as well, while the camel case does not.

Using the Pascal case, the file name will be `ServiceSection.jsx`.

```jsx
const ServiceSection = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>I Pascal Case Naming</h1>
      <p>And I'm also proud of it!</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ServiceSection;
```

**Recommended:**

## **File and Folder Naming Conventions**

> A well-named file or folder can help you and other developers find and understand your code more quickly.

In NextJS, it is recommended to use lowercase letters and hyphens to separate words in file and folder names. This makes it easier to read and avoids confusion when working with different file types. For example, instead of using `AboutUs.js`, use `about-us.js`.

## **Component Naming Conventions**

When creating components in NextJS, it is best to use **PascalCase** for naming. This convention makes it easier to differentiate between components and regular HTML elements. For example, instead of using `my-container`, use `MyContainer`.

## **Route Naming Conventions**

Routes in NextJS should follow the same naming conventions as file and folder names. This makes it easier to identify routes and avoids confusion when navigating through your application. For example, instead of using `/aboutUs`, use `/about-us`.

## **SEO Friendly Naming Conventions**

Using proper naming conventions can also improve your website’s SEO. It is important to use relevant keywords in your file and folder names, as well as in your component and route names. This helps search engines understand what your website is about and improves your chances of ranking higher in search results.

# **Conclusion:**

In conclusion, using proper naming conventions in NextJS is crucial for maintaining clean and readable code, as well as improving your website’s SEO. By following the best practices discussed in this blog post, you can make your code more maintainable and increase your website’s visibility online.

Remember to use lowercase and hyphens in file and folder names, PascalCase in component names, and relevant keywords in all of your naming conventions. By doing so, you can ensure that your website is both user-friendly and SEO-friendly.
